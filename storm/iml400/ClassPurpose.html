					<p style="font-family:Avenir Next Condensed">Long story short, I like to make things. 
					Short story long, my primary academic focus is quite adequately captured by the name of my major: 
					International Relations and Global Business. Long and vague, and covering many many areas of study.
					 It took two years for me to realize that reading theories written decades ago by old men wasn't 
					 sufficiently broadening my knowledge and worldview as much as I hoped. I need to be doing creative
					  things, while still gearing it towards making a difference or serving others. I am taking this 
					  class because I want to learn more and more ways to represent ideas and information that is 
					  interesting to me in visually compelling and beautiful ways. I want to focus on an intersection 
					 of global/social issues and digital media. Whether it's through filming documentaries, writing
					 articles, building sites and programs, or visualizing info, there is a lot that I can learn in this space.    </br>
					
					I hope to one day in this class reach a point where things I learn about coding and the different languages come easy to me. I currently can't do anything without referring to previous templates and 600 strangers from the internet. I also hope to learn about User Experience, which always sounded like a field I would love and in which I would flourish.
